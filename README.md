# Notion Electron

This is just a test repository, to build notion using nativefier, and see if using it's optimizations, the application can be improved, namely in battery life, and responsiveness.

Instructions for building: (**MAC ONLY FOR NOW**)

1. Download/Clone this repo.
2. Install Nativefier: [Guide](https://github.com/nativefier/nativefier#installation)
3. Run: 
   ```bash
   nativefier --name 'Notion' "notion.so" --inject site.css --title-bar-style 'hiddenInset' -i n.icns
   ```

Then drag the output application `Notion.app` into your Applications folder. You can change the name from `Notion` to whatever you want if itâ€™s causing problems with the other notion app you have.



For non Mac users, just do:

```bash
nativefier --name 'Notion' "notion.so" 
```



**There are binaries in release, but these were generated by me on my computer, they might not work on yours!!**
